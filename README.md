Yes, it's spelt that way on purpose.<br />
- Sorcerer<br />
- Sorce - r - er<br />
- Source - r - er<br />
- Sourcerer<br />

**Get it?** Because the app's main purpose is to *source* urls? K.<br />

## Purpose?
Since the meme app íFunny has a reletively annoying saving system, I decided to make **MSrc** as an alternate means to saving images/videos in a hassle-free manner that yields better quality saves, and to provide QoL functionality not seen in the offical app.<br />

## Overview
Here's a brief comparison of both apps' functionality
MSrc | Official
-|-
Fetch/save original images and videos | Save post-processed, low quality images w/ watermark
Copy urls leading to .jpg/.mp4 sources | Copy urls leading to the official website
Pause and seek videos | Unable to control videos
Quick cropping of images before saving | -
Fetch/save user profile pictures | -
Quick shortcut to download history on device | -
Reverse image search images in-app | -
